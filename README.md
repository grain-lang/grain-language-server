# Language Server and editor extension support for Grain 

This extension adds language support for [Grain](grain-lang.org) to Visual Studio Code.

Currently the LSP server is embedded in the vscode extension and is
written in Typescript.  The next version will be written in ReasonML and will be a separate language server, with just the client in the 
vscode extension.
